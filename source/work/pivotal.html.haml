    %p During my time at Digital Telepathy, I was added to the Pivotal account team. Instead of being responsible for writing production-ready code, my primary focus on the team was to utilize my skillset to help translate and communicate our designers' intentions to Pivotal's development team. Working closely with our designers, I built prototypes of interactions in private CodePens. This allowed our designers to more easily communicate their ideas to Pivotal by showing them while talking through the designs. When it came time to implement, I documented each prototype with comments explaining the methods I was using and then share it with Pivotal's development team so they could have a running start.

    %p.caption We liked to use assets and content that were as close to final as possible so prototypes could be shared with stakeholders, as well.
