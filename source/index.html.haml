      %strong A front-end developer with a background in design and a penchant for simplyfying user experiences.
      From designing point-perfect print pieces to developing cutting-edge user interfaces, I've had the fortune of experiencing wildly varied applications of design thinking. In recent years, I've found a passion for front-end development. Though my preferred work lives in a code editor, my experience allows me to contribute a unique outlook to discussions surrounding strategy and user experience.

          %p.lead Front-end architecture and development
          %p.description As the main tool on my workbench, I am most comfortable working with front-end technologies. Describing a design in language and seeing it come to life is a never-ending thrill.

          %p.lead Stratigec thinking
          %p.description The story doesn't begin or end simply with writing code. I'm especially adept at understanding the bigger objectives and concepting wholistic solutions.

          %p.lead Markup and Styles
          %p.description While I'm completely comfortable writing vanilla HTML and CSS, I prefer using preprocessors to generate the expected output. In my experience, the differences between most similar technologies are minimal, but my personal favorites are HAML for HTML and SCSS for CSS.
        %li
          %p.lead JavaScript
          %p.description Over the years, I've adopted the the object-oriented style for most things I write. I am very familiar with using jQuery to ease and expedite JS development. However, with the growth of Node.js and NPM, my appreciation and use of JavaScript has evolved considerably.

        %li
          %p.lead Front-end frameworks
          %p.description When it comes to styles and basic interaction, I'm well-versed in bending Bootstrap(3) to the will of the design. Intrigued by many JS frameworks, I have a working knowledge of React and Angular.

        %li
          %p.lead Task Runners
          %p.description Anything that can be used for automation is a winner in my eyes. Gulp is my personal favorite of mine. Though not task runners officially, I love using dependency management tools like NPM and Bower. And as a Ruby-ist in my freetime, I'm also familiar with Rake, Thor, and Bundler.

        %li
          %p.lead Static-site Generators
          %p.description Though their application isn't always the right answer, I like using static-site generators when applicable. A personal favorite of mine is the robust Ruby-based Middleman. Also, I enjoy rolling my own with Gulp to create tailored build systems.

        %li
          %p.lead Back-end and other languages
          %p.description Ruby is my go-to non-front-end language. I often write and run .rb files for specialized tasks. I'm also comfortable with Rails and Sinatra. Though I haven't used it extinsively, I'm comfortable with Python. Finally, I know my way around PHP, and, specifically, its use in WordPress.

        %li
          %p.lead Design tools
          %p.description I'm very comfortable in Adobe's Creative Cloud apps and tools for their wide variety of uses. Also, I'm familiar with InVision as a tool for communicating and prototyping.

          %p.lead Miscellaneous
          %p.description A few years ago, a colleague joked that I'd taken the "oath of the command line" when I ditched a GUI version control app. Turns out he was right as I routinely juggle a few prompts to manage my workflow. Speaking of version control, I'm most comfortable with Git. I'm also a big fan of GitHub and their suite of tools. When writing and reading code, Sublime is my editor of choice.
